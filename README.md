# Tiny utilities for your shell

Doing the same task again and again is tedious,  
especially going through a lot of logs  
searching for a specific keyword.

When Ctl+F hits its limits,  
there comes *grep*.
A powerfull tool, definitely the next step.  
But sometimes You don't use it to its full. 
You like to do it YOUR way.
And that's why this repo was founded. 

Hooray!
